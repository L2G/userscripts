# About the L2G/userscripts repo

This is a Git repository for the userscripts I'm developing. Its home is:
https://github.com/L2G/userscripts

Userscripts are small JavaScript files designed to be inserted on-the-fly into
Web pages to add functionality to them, to link to other services, or simply
to make them look better. The concept was introduced by
[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/),
an extension for Firefox, but now can be used on most any Web browser (either
natively or with the help of an extension or plugin).  One popular catalog of
userscripts is [Userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org/).


## What's in here

The development for each userscript is in its own branch:

 * `loosen-up` -- *Loosen Up!*, designed to make rigid Web page layouts more
   liquid and to make them fit a browser window of any width.
 * `mbrpt` -- *MusicBrainsz Random Page Turn* (great name, right?), which adds
   a button to any multi-page report on [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/)
   that links to a random page.
 * `USE` -- the *Universal Subtitles Enabler*, designed to embed
   [Universal Subtitles'](http://universalsubtitles.org/) subtitles directly
   into popular video websites.

For the current list of branches, browse the repo on GitHub or use the `git
branch -r` command in your own cloned repo.
